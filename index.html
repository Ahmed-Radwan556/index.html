<br><b>What do you think Artificial Intelligence is?</b><br/>
Examples of these tasks are visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.<br/>
<br><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> term was coined by John McCarthy in 1956. He defined it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” AI is the branch of computer science which deals with the study and design of intelligent agents that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. AI may be defined as: “The ability to hold two different ideas in mind at the same time
and still remain the ability to fucntion”. But AI must include the learning from past experience, reasoning for the decision making, inference power and quick response. Also it must be able to take decisions on the basis of priorities and tackle complexity and ambiguity. Machines programmed to carry out tasks, when carried out by humans would require intelligence, are said to possess artificial intelligence. AI's scientific goal is to
understand int lligence by building computer programs that exhibit intelligent behavior by using symbolic inference, or reasoning inide the machine. AI definition is not time-independent. It gives the judgment of any system by keeping time in mind.

<br><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that would require human intelligence.<br/>
<br><b>Artificial Intelligence </b> In movies, robots are able to talk,think, have emotions, and make decisions just like humans.
