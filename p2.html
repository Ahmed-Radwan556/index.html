  <tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td><b>Natural Language Generation</b></td>
    <td> itâ€™s a tool that produces text from the computer data. Currently used in customer service, report generation, and summarizing business intelligence insights.</td>	
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td><b>Speech Recognition</b></td>
	<td>Transcribes and transforms human speech into a format useful for computer applications. Presently used in interactive voice response systems and mobile applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td><b>Virtual Agent</b></td>
	<td>A Virtual Agentis a computer generated, animated, artificial intelligence virtual character (usually with anthropomorphic appearance) that serves as an online customer service representative. It leads an intelligent conversation with users, responds to their questions and performs adequate non-verbal behavior. An example of a typical Virtual Agent is Louise, the Virtual Agent of eBay, created by a French/American developer VirtuOz.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td><b>Machine Learning</b></td>
	<td>Provides algorithms, APIs (Application Program interface) development and training toolkits, data, as well as computing power to design, train, and deploy models into applications, processes, and other machines. Currently used in a wide range of enterprise applications, mostly `involving prediction or classification.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5.</td>
    <td><b>Deep Learning Platforms</b></td>
	<td>A special type of machine learning consisting of artificial neural networks with multiple abstraction layers. Currently used in pattern recognition and classification applications supported by very large data sets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.</td>
    <td><b>Biometrics</b></td>
	<td>Biometrics uses methods for unique recognition of humans based upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits. In computer science, particularly, biometrics is used as a form of identity access management and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance. Currently used in market research.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.</td>
    <td><b>Robotic Process Automation</b></td>
	<td>using scripts and other methods to automate human action to support efficient business processes. Currently used where it is inefficient for humans to execute a task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8.</td>
    <td><b>Text Analytics and NLP</b></td>
	<td>Natural language processing (NLP) uses and supports text analytics by facilitating the understanding of sentence structure and meaning, sentiment, and intent through statistical and machine learning methods. Currently used in fraud detection and security, a wide range of automated assistants, and applications for mining unstructured data.</td>
